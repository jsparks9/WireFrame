        <p>The higher someones narcissism, the more they think they're smarter, better, and more entitled than others. By their internal logic, others are thus inferior and undeserving of even basic respect. Though such delusions seem to be based in the narcissist's real or imagined status or position, the superiority feelings of a narcissist are based on their own internal mechanisms and not reality.</p></div>
		<p>Many find that prolonged interaction with a narcissist produces various problems in their life due to abuse. The hypothesis presented here is that the root of such abuse is a distorted concept of respect. Respect to the narcissist means a position of superiority, privilege, and entitlement to act as per their wishes with little to no consideration for others. It is a state of artificial freedom found in only considering own desires and wishes and not those of others. Should others disagree, they are labeled as being disrespectful. More specifically, the narcissist views respect as the right to disresepct others. Hence, victims are left gasping for security that comes with respect. Some are left ambitiously trying to attain positions of prestige that may promise respect and thus safety from exploitation. The purpose of this website is to help victims of narcissistic abuse realize healthy boundaries when it comes to the concept of respect. Everyone deserves basic respect, and those who deny others such basic respect are violating basic social boundaries. Regardless of the real or imagined status of a person, they must treat everyone with at least basic respect.</p>
